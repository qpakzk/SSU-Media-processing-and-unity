Hello, I'm Sangwon Hong. I'm a Junior Software Engineer. I'm a senior undergrad in School of Computer Science and Engineering, College of IT, Soongil University, Seoul, Korea. I'm planning to go to graduate school. I'm interested in Blockchain and Systems (Linux Kernel).

This blog is for a class, __Introduction to Information and Art__ , Global School of Media, Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea. I'll post about processing and unity.
